we had an issue where when typing the line in command prompt, it would not work correctly, BUT THE LINE I GAVE YOU WORKS, SO PLEASE USE THAT LINE TO RUN THE PROGRAM, AND IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES, PLEASE LET ME KNOW, AND I WILL HELP YOU OUT. THANK YOU. I do not want to get deducted points if it doesn't work this type, but I typed that in after I did "cd" until i got into my assignment4 folder(btw im using the same folder name for assignment 5 and 6) NOT RES, and then I typed that line and it worked.

Open the terminal, and navigate to the assignment4 folder, and once you do that, type in (AND DO NOT COPY AND PASTE THIS AT ALL, TYPE IT IN CAREFULLY) "java -jar "./res/assigment4.jar", and press ENTER. This will open the GUI interface, and you can click on create portfolio to type in a name of a portfolio, press enter, then click manage portfolios, from the dropdown click the portfolio you want to manage, and from there you can add a stock, sell stock, check its composition and value as well. ALSOOO, VERY IMPORTANT NOTE, TO SEE YOUR DATA, THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO FOR EXAMPLE.

FOR GUI ONCE YOU OPEN IT
1. Click on create portfolio, and type in a name, and press enter.

2. Click on manage portfolios, and click the dropdown and click the portfolio you just created, and press enter.

3. Type 1 and enter to buy stock, and type in the stock symbol, press enter, enter quantity and press enter, and enter the year you want to add it, press enter, enter the month, enter, and day, and press enter. NOW YOU WILL BE WONDERING WHY YOUR DATA DID NOT SHOW UP, LOOK AT STEP 4.

4. AFTER YOU DO THIS, YOU WILL BE PROMPTED BACK TO THE MANAGE PORTFOLIO MENU, I WANT YOU TO CLICK CANCEL,AND THEN FULLSCREEN THE WINDOW BY PRESSING THE FULLSCREEN BUTTON (for windows its top right, and for mac its top left), AND THEN YOU WILL SEE THE INFORMATION OF YOU CREATING YOUR PORTFOLIO AND ADDING YOUR STOCK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.

4. Now if you want to check the composition for example, click manage portfolio again, click the portfolio you want to manage and press enter, then press 3, then enter, then enter a year, enter, month, enter, and day, and press enter. NOW CLICK CANCEL, AND THEN SCROLL DOWN AT THE BOTTOM A LITTLE TO SEE YOUR COMPOSITION, AND DO THIS AGAIN FOR THE VALUE, BUT FOLLOW THE STEPS TO GET THE VALUE AND YOU WILL SEE IT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, you just have to scroll a little bit :) I HOPE THIS IS CONCISE, IF NOT, I WILL HAPPILY HELP YOU OUT AND DEMONSTRATE IT WITH A RECORDING IF NEEDED.

You can click QUIT as well to quit the program.

Now, if you wanted to check the text based interface again, you would want to type in (AND DO NOT COPY AND PASTE THIS AT ALL, TYPE IT IN CAREFULLY) "java -jar "./res/assigment4.jar" -text", and press ENTER. This will open the text based interface, and you can run the program from there. You can type 4 and press enter and then type in your portfolio name, and then type 5 and press enter to manage the portfolio, and it will have similar features like adding and selling stock, checking composition and distribution, total value, and to rebalance it and check the performance of the portfolio.

P.S. the list of stocks and the dates are all stored in the res folder under stockDataFiles. Though there aren't a lot of them, you can create the data after you are done running your code, and once you exit, it will update in the stockDataFiles. And the list of portfolios is stored in the portfolios file in the res folder.
